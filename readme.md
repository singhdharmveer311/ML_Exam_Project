### Student Name: Rahul Trivedi

### Student Number: 69535

#### Description:

Project directory includes following files:

- **app.py**: A Flask API script used to serve the trained model for predictions. This script sets up an endpoint that takes input features and returns the predicted credit score.
- **best_svm_model.joblib**: The trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model saved in a joblib file. This model is used for making predictions on new data.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the dependencies and Python packages required to run the project. This includes Flask, scikit-learn, and any other libraries used in the project.

#### Running API:

```bash
python3 app.py
```
